<p><em><span style="color: #3d3c40;">The couriers lurk in courier central, telling tales of deliveries missed and hearts broken. Regaling themselves on sweet, sweet tears, they laugh at stories of doorknocks followed by hasty getaways. They smirk as old, grizzled couriers teach how to break contents without damaging packaging - much as a senior sergeant might instruct a probationary constable in the artÂ of the phone book interrogation. They leave this happy place only when reliably informed their recipients have left their homes - or are at the very least in the shower.</span></em></p>
