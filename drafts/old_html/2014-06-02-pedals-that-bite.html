<p>I bought Shimano XC Race Pedals (Grey) when I found them cheap on Wiggle, as my older SPD pedals were creaking. I hate noise when I ride. The XTR pedals look great, notice the milled surface just above the logo? Better shoe-pedal engagement says Shimano. But there lies the problem.</p>

<p>The edges of these pedals are sharp! <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">I wrote about this in a review on Wiggle but they didn't publish it - why would they publish an honest review that doesn't help sell pedals? They work fine so I'm not returning them, I just need to get around to Dremeling those edges to make them less like James Bond's DB5 tire shredders.</span></p>
