	<h2>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Powered Case</h2>
	<h2>New Raspberry Pi!</h2>
<p>Cool! Naturally I ordered one. Right about the time that I bought the Prusa 3D printer. I wasn't planning on using the Pi 4 for the printer but I did try out the Pi Zero that the printer is designed to fit and performance is just horrible. Neat design Prusa, but the Pi Zero just isn't powerful enough.</p>
<p>So the Pi 4 - my 1GB model, because 4GB models are backordered until 2023 or something - gets the job. But it requires USB-C power. USB-C is mainstream now but that just means new devices come with it, and I haven't hoarded enough old ones to have any spare. I have two that can supply the 15W the Pi needs and both are used every day for something else. Of course I could buy an official supply but it's still a plugpack and I just don't like plug packs. The narrow cable tangles more easily and the chunky plugpack covers more than one mains slot, usually. So I did the following - after a recent break where I shoved everything to one side for some other tasks - Hi Pete!</p>
<h2>Power Supply Modules</h2>
<p>Fixing the Amiga I found that the power supply was weak enough that it would occasionally crash or have graphics corruption. Probably it was the electrolytic capacitors but I just replaced the old Amiga module with a new Mean Well RPT-60B - more capable than the old module, more efficient, cheap. So when it came time to power the Pi I looked, expecting there would be a cheap module that could do that job too. There is - the Mean Well MFM-15-5. It's tiny. </p>
<p>https://www.meanwell-web.com/content/files/pdfs/productPdfs/MW/MFM-15/MFM-15-spec.pdf</p>
<p>Next, how to get mains into the module? I recently bought some IEC C8 AC inlets. I've got tons of cables and like the way things like the Apple TV just plug in and go. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Finally, how to get power into the Raspberry Pi? People have been doing Power over Ethernet (PoE) with varying degrees of success so I figured it was possible. Worst case I could connect a USB-C cable and run power out and then back into the side. Turns out none of that would be necessary because the Pi can be powered from the header pins! Specifically, 4 and 6 need 5V and ground.</p>
<p>To keep the Pi looking unaltered I chose to attach the pins to the bottom of the Pi. By heating and then pulling hard with a pair of pliers I was able to remove both pins 4 and 6, then clean up the holes with solder wick and push in some right-angled header pins. These pins make the Pi header look unaltered while providing two right-angled connection points underneath the Pi. </p>
<h2>3D Design Time</h2>
<p>I'm experimenting with Shapr3D on the iPad Pro. I bought a subscription last time they had a discount offer and I tried to use it, but mouse and keyboard still just feel better to me. I'm going to push ahead with Shapr3D on the next project but for this one i stuck with Autodesk's Fusion 360. Given that I'm unlikely to make $100k with my 3D designs this year (LOL) the license is free.</p>
<p>So the basic problem was to produce a Raspberry Pi case with space for AC power inlet, AC-DC converter module and the usual Pi things like access to headers, camera connector etc. Another thing to think about was ventilation. I couldn't expect to make something as small as possible, completely exposed, and not run into the derating curve of the power module causing brownouts and Pi crashes. I tried to make open sides so that airflow was possible but it would not be possible to poke a paper clip into the mains side of the power supply. Anyone bent on getting a jolt will find it far easier to poke something into a mains socket than this power supply.</p>
<h2>Printable?</h2>
<p>After a few revisions the problem was down to how to make the thing most printable. I really wanted to have a pencil-case style cover to the power supply section where you just slide in the cover and escure with one screw, but the printer didn't like that. The thing to remember with 3D printing is that everything happens bottom-up - you can make a little overhang each layer, but if you make a big overhang then the plastic will just sag and look horrible, if it works at all. </p>
<p>I also wanted to reduce the amount of plastic used. That meant not having thick columns of plastic all the way up from the base just to support a single nut in each corner. That's why the insides of the power supply section look like some kind of Bavarian castle with the nut-supporting part tapering down to a point at the base. Each layer has overhang, but it is not so great that the printer can't handle it.</p>
<p>I borrowed some design ideas from Pusa on the way. The M2.5 nuts in the project are used in two ways, pushed up into a hexagonal cut so that the standard size bolts I wanted to use (20mm) can engage and hold down the lid of the Pi. The nuts in the power supply section are pushed in horizontally in the Bavarian castle bits to be at the correct height for some 8mm bolts.</p>
<h2>Working</h2>
<p>The final revision is printing right now. I printed one case last night with a time of 8.5 hours, today I cranked it up to use the finest setting the 0.4mm nozzle can handle - here's the time lapse.</p>
<p><a href="/images/a1200-kbd-9/case-closed.jpg"><img alt="Case closed" src="/images/a1200-kbd-9/thumb-case-closed.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Only 14 hours of printing...</p>
<p>After the Pi 4 appeared and everone bought one twitter posts started appearing saying things like "here's another one to gather dust". Well problem solved - you have a Pi to make your 3D printer more useful. And then you use the printer to make the Pi better. And so on for ever.</p>
