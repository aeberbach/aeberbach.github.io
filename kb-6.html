</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Fitting the PCB</h1>
<p>The PCB is back! It's really big. I can get a 104-key modern board in my backpack but not this PCB! It arrived right on time and very carefully packed. This is a simple board so the difficulty rating is pretty low but the manufacturer really has done a great job and I would not hesitate to use them again.</p>
<h2>Does it fit?</h2>
<p>No. I kind of expected to find a few things that needed fixing and I did. This is what comes of not having a piece of 2mm material to fit in place and see where the problems might be before having a PCB made.
1. Too high! The board sits perfectly across the width of the case, right on the thin ledges provided in the bottom case mold. Unfortunately in this position the keyswitches sit up too high.
2. Too thick! The PCB material is too thick to fit under the clips at the front of the Amiga case. That's OK, I can route it back and add a strip of metal attached to the front of the PCB that will fit.
3. No LED window! The top half of the case has a small PCB with the LEDs on it. The original keyboard has a window routed out so it will fit. I overlooked this.
4. Flexy! This will definitely require aluminium angle at the top edge to stop the flex, as expected.</p>
<h2>Make it fit - lower It</h2>
<p>Sitting up on the supports makes the keys too high. The only thing to do is trim the edge of the board so that it can drop down inside the case, below the supports, but still be supported somehow. There is room for screws and brackets if careful. Is there an aluminium extrusion somewhere that could do this? A quick search produced no joy, at one end Bunnings with a lot of standard and chunky extrusions that don't look useful and at the other end a lot of industrial suppliers that can probably do anything but say "call us for a quote". Small quantities of unusual angle could easily cost more than my whole project, so I gave that up.
Then I thought about routing some aluminium. For a Mac mini project some time ago I routed a CD slot in a sheet of aluminium. It does dull your router bits but if everything is well supported and you are careful, no problem. (That's what using a router is really - 95% preparation, 5% cutting.) If I took some 3mm thick right angle and routed in from the outside corner I could create a step-shaped piece that would sit on the case ledge, then drop down to support the keyboard. The height this drops the keyboard by would be controlled by the depth of the cut with any excess trimmed off the top so the case can close. With 3mm of thickness, that allows for 2mm siting on the ledge (plenty) and 1mm of material left to support the keyboard (plenty).
I did not like the idea of putting my fingers 10mm from a spinning router bit so I first made a rebate along the edge of a piece of thick ply then placed the angle wrapping around the timber with one face in the rebate. Then attached with screws so that the face that will be routed is exposed.</p>
<p>Planned revision 2 changes:
- route out the LED window
- reduce the size of the PCB to account for aluminium angle supports all round</p>
