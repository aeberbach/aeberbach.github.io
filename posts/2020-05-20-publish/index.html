I hate Ruby. I didn't hate Python, but given the chance to use Swift instead why wouldn't I switch? Having the ability to use only Xcode and git is fantastic.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> is available on Github. John Sundell uses it to build <a href="https://swiftbysundell.com">Swift by Sundell</a>, which looks as good as I am ever going to need.</p><p>It's very easy to set up, at least as easy as Jekyll or Pelican. It's totally easy to convert old blogs. I chose to rearrange images somewhat so converting absolutely everything, including fixing up some images and typos, took just a few hours. If you have an interest take a look, I think you will like it.</p><p>Obviously this is pretty vanilla right now because I have read nothing but the github page, but I think it's got a lot of potential.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/publishing">publishing</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
