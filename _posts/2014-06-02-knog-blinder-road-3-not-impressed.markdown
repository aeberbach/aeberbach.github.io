I was in the bike shop for no good reason other than there was a bike shop in my way, and this light caught my eye. It's a Knog Blinder Road 3 - neat little package with a very bright light that looked great in the shop. Australian company too. My riding has been frequent enough that I felt OK spending another hundred-odd on lights, so I bought this and a matching rear light, a Blinder 4V.  
 At first glance the Blinder Road 3 is a neat design - a rechargeable light with a fold-out USB connector built in! Except that the curvature of the light's mount and the position of the USB connector is such that it can't plug directly into anything much, so a short USB extender cable is provided. And this connector is positioned under the mount, so the light has to come right off the bike for it to be charged. That's strike 1.  
 Next the mount itself. It's a stretchy silicon strap that has a hook and lever design, the lever meets with the strap behind whichever bar you are going to attach the light to and then is folded back flat against the bar. Just like a guitar case's latch. That's fine, except that my bars are a bit thin, so the stretch wasn't tight enough to stop the light from drooping after bumps. (Perhaps this was not an issue with the lighter-in-front Blinder Road 2) I padded it with some rubber, but then the latch wouldn't stay shut.  
 One morning I noticed the latch wasn't shut as I rolled down the bike path. I tried to grab it, but my gloved hands were a bit clumsy and soon it was bouncing down the road. It didn't break but did get scratched up. That's strike 2.

Two buttons control the light. One selects the mode of the light and the other toggles a high beam mode, so whichever mode you are in it can get a lot brighter - in high beam, the green indicator light turns blue. A long press on the mode button turns the light on and another turns it off. A short press switches between the modes. Time your press wrong and it does the wrong thing, and the buttons are very small and hard to press in gloves. I'm not sure why there is a high beam button since it is all but impossible to find while riding. That's strike 3.  
 I wish I had not spent the money to find out about the Knog Blinder Road 3, I am back to using the Moon X Power 500.

The Moon light has a mount that attaches securely to the bike, then the light slides off for charging via a mini-USB connector. It has one button that is large enough to press while wearing gloves, though even larger would be good in winter. It seems as bright or better than the Knog light but I admit I have not tested them objectively. My only big complaint is that it doesn't use a stainless bolt in its mount, so I found it had rusted somewhat as I took it off after 6 months, but grease on the thread made it better and should keep it from rusting further.

I am less disappointed in the Blinder R rear light, it is still on my bike. Apparently my seat post is just the right diameter for the mount to work, and since there is only one button (and choosing the right mode is far less critical) I can live with it - but it's still too small and in an awkward place. I expect I'll go back to using the Tioga Dual Eyes once the power runs out since the hidden USB plug is still a problem on the Blinder 4\. Weeks have passed and it's still going strong so I have to give it some credit for battery capacity.  
 Final note - if you ride with a high-powered front light on your bike, point the beam down at the ground a few metres in front of your bike. Don't blind everyone coming the other way - and that means don't stick a high-powered light on your helmet, blinding everyone you look at. Thanks.
