![Death Screen for Day Z](assets/dayzyouaredeadpvp.jpg)  
Day Z has two big problems. One is hackers, the other is motivation. I wouldn’t have discovered the second without the first.  
 What this isn’t is a post about blaming [Bohemia Interactive](http://www.bistudio.com/ "Bohemia Interactive") (makers of Arma II) or [Dean “Rocket” Hall](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/dean-rocket-hall/ "Rock Paper Shotgun") for anything. I admire both for what they have produced and I’m grateful for the fun I had while I was playing it. I just don’t have enough game time to waste on something that is so totally broken.  
 Here’s a post I wrote on arstechnica.com that starts right after a great game session but ends with me removing the game:  
 _More fun and games with hackers but I’m benefiting more than losing. I started again near Elektro after something happened to kill my previous character, a shame but not incredibly surprising. With nothing to lose I ran in and found a hatchet in the first shed, then when into church. Two bodies… uh oh. Sure enough something unseen knocked me out but when I recovered no bleeding and no further attacks – down to 7000 blood though. I got a fair bit of stuff from one of the bodies including NVG, GPS, all the usual hacker stuff. No weapons to speak of. I needed food after the big hit I took so went and looted the store where I picked up a Lee Enfield. A residential got me a Makarov. Then a zombie hit me and broke my leg, damnit. I was only a couple of blocks from hospital so decided to try and crawl there but took a fall off a doorstep while sneaking through the multi-level residential – must have been at least 8 inches high – and died. So I spawned and decided to run back and reclaim those NVGs, never had them before. I made it but came across another survivor – let him have a whole Makarov clip to himself and probably hit him more than once because I snuck away and didn’t get followed. I hit the hospital quickly to stock up then it was time to get out of town. I crawled up the hill, cresting to find the big red square on the map was another fire station and got that sinking feeling, expecting to die – I saw another survivor ahead of me sneaking in there and didn’t want to lose all my just-recovered stuff. Then I got the good idea to use the NVGs by switching to a server where it’s night time. Crawled in, found three bodies in the parking bay, one ghillied – maybe someone dropped a grenade because nobody else was about, or so I thought. I looted a M4A1 and a 1911 and was feeling pretty happy with myself when someone else appeared – no NVGs so he didn’t see me, and was crawling towards me. I still had the pistol equipped and I did a bad thing, shooting him – not killing, but he turned and ran out of there. So did I a short interval later, deciding to get out and enjoy my gear while I had it. I nearly ran into another guy but ducked in time and he didn’t see me either, then I crawled on out of there and headed NW following the power lines. I expected to hit the road and then move north to Pusta. Somehow I missed Pusta (never saw the road) and found myself north of Prigorodky where I enjoyed the NVG experience, watching some new spawn swinging a flashlight around wildly, then watched it move a bit more quickly for a short while before stopping – then a death message. I moved further west looking over the fields hoping for a cow since my health was down around 6000, figured I would do some cooking. A chicken popped up in front of me so I aimed my 1911, was just zooming in to line it up in the sights when I heard the loudest gunshot I have ever heard and I was dead – AS50? Bugger. I nearly called it a night and said easy come, easy go, but the next spawn was just a little west of Elektro so I decided to do the impossible and run back to my corpse in the dark. The rocks of Pik Kozlovo were nearly impassable on a moonless night and on a server with 55 players I knew I would be dead if I used the flashlight. I got to the railway line sw of the rocks finally and made it to the first building in Prigorodky then headed north to pick up the power lines against the sky that I had been following previously, then west in the hope of hearing flies. To my amazement I did, I zeroed in on the sound and the flashlight confirmed that I had found my corpse unlooted. I geared up again, didn’t attract the sniper’s attention again (probably felt sorry for anyone dumb enough to turn on a flashlight in an open field) and headed out to the north toward Mogilevka, fully geared with 12000 blood! That’s a pretty steep hill so it took me some time, even zigzagging. It had been raining since a little before the previous death. As I crested the hill I started coughing with temperature flashing, no antibiotics of course. I decided to head back down into the deeper woods to see about lighting a fire to warm up, but while I had picked up the matches, no wood and no hatchet! In hindsight probably not a great idea since fires would attract a lot of attention – maybe I should light one then hang out and see who comes to investigate, mwahaha! Into Mogilevka then. Heading down to the road I nearly tripped over a quad bike parked on the side of the hill. It was loaded: FN FAL scoped, Bizon, L85, shotgun with flashlight etc. I left the bike because last time I rode one it somehow flew in the air and killed me. Did replace my M1A1 with a L85 and three mags. The thermal scope is awesome and for once I felt secure that I could look around and see anyone. The laser is nice in NVG view also. Probably I should have blown up the quad bike but I might have alerted the owner, I left it there – can imagine his confusion – “What, I didn’t make a shitty iron sight M4A1!?” Then into the big barn where my temperature stopped flashing quickly, I saw a rabbit and decided to test out my new rifle! I missed high of course, forgot to zero the sights. And lots of zombies heard me but in the dark they didn’t do much towards entering the barn. I ended the night in a small residential in town hoping the cough would go away._  
 _Not sure how I’m feeling about this game. Now I have just about all the gear I ever wanted I’m not sure what to do – still haven’t done a cow barbecue so maybe that’s my next plan. The thing that keeps my attention is that you’re never ever safe. Unlike Warcraft where you can gear up and run through noob areas like a god, you can die in the blink of an eye. Even this cold could end up taking me out._  
 _- update – I shot and ate a sheep and that kept me going long enough to declare myself Lord of Castle Zub, and to spare a guy I saw crawling through the bush through my thermal scope. Back in Cherno in the military tents there was a box of antibiotics! Cough gone, but down to 6000 blood. And stupidly I didn’t just take the STANAG mags I found for my L85, I tried to put the M4A3 CCO they were lying with in my backpack. ALL the mags disappeared. Now I have M4A3 CCO & L85 but no ammunition._  
 _- update – logged back in, got one STANAG and a G17 with four mags. Then, instakilled by some hack – teleported into a field with everyone else. I think I am done with this game. Hacking giveth, and hacking taketh away._  
 There were some incredible moments in that life and I really felt the adrenalin that [Sacriel42 describes in his great videos of Day Z squad gameplay](http://www.youtube.com/user/sacriel42 "Sacriel Day Z squad video"). (But even there, notice how his squad finds a working helo, a L85, a SVD camo and so on – that’s not just great luck.) The death from falling off a doorstep or the broken legs that arise from stepping over a tent I can ignore. It started to go downhill due to an inventory system that is so broken things disappear when they don’t fit in a pack (really, four STANAG mags just vaporised). Then it was all taken away by some loser who downloaded a script.  
 This wouldn’t be so bad if these were university days again and I could spend 6 hours a day gaming but time is at a premium now. There’s no point in playing a game where progress can be wiped out by some chuckling idiot whose life is so meaningless that assuming a bunch of strangers have been inconvenienced brings satisfaction. I probably should have known better than to be playing right after school finished.  
 Second problem – once a character has all the gear they want there’s nothing to do. So people with sniper rifles hang out on spots overlooking popular spots and snipe other players. Nothing wrong with that, I’m fine with losing everything to a skilled player. When it gets hard to take is when everyone has a hacker-spawned AS50 or L85 and there are 10 snipers camped all around the starter towns. And everyone does have all that gear, I found it less than two hours into the life I posted about.  
 If the script kids couldn’t get anything they want instantly – and if their bodies and vehicles full of the rarest weapons and gear weren’t lying around for any new spawn to find – then this problem might not exist. With death as near as it is in this game nobody would have their gear very long. Everyone would have to adapt to what they find, maybe settling for an AKM as a good primary weapon. There would be a lot more people just sneaking around Cherno and Elektro getting a basic kit together before heading out to the wilderness to begin the process of surviving by hunting, cooking and finding water. Which I think is the original vision of this mod.  
 I’ve tried to think of what could comprise an endgame if that wasn’t the case, if people did survive, gear intact for long periods. World of Warcraft has endless raids to do, and heroic versions of those same raids to get even better gear. I’m not sure scenarios like assassinating a general or capturing a hill could fulfil the same role in Day Z but something is needed.  
 Could there be other regions that open to players who complete certain challenges? A ferry that can only be operated after enough fuel is gathered to make it run, opening the path to a new region? A currency (cans of beans, naturally!) that can be spent with NPCs to buy ammunition? Nethack’s shopkeepers come to mind – they would have to be tougher than players obviously, or protected behind armour somehow. The ability to attract followers or gain rights to a stronghold complete with border defences? Finding a cure for the Zombie sickness?  
 [“The War Z”](http://thewarz.com/ "<cough>blatant copy that sucks</cough>") is a commercial effort that owes a lot to Day Z. It’s pretty much a copy for all I know about it at this stage. I bet it isn’t the only one in planning right now though. Like all the WWII games that appeared in the early 2000s, these things come in groups. Some big and well-funded studios have to be working on similar things as Day Z must have caused the “why didn’t we think of that?” reaction all over the industry. It’s the WoW killer everyone has been dreaming of. Competition should be interesting – even if all the copies do dumb it down to console levels of difficulty, and I fear they will. Sorry to say that Day Z seems to have missed the boat by being based on Arma II, a system designed to allow easy scripting and without much thought of policing those scripts.  
 Technical notes – I played the game on a 2012 15″ retina MacBook Pro running Windows 7 under Boot Camp, with the Arma II/Operation Arrowhead bought from Steam. Handled it easily, as you would hope from this year’s hardware running an old game. Windows 7 doesn’t handle a 2880×1800 screen too well though – lots of squinting going on until you adjust text size. I used [Day Z Commander](http://www.dayzcommander.com/ "Day Z Commander") to download the mod, updates and join servers – too easy, if you play you need this. An external full-width Apple keyboard gives access to all the keys you need for Day Z, there are some important ones on the numeric keypad you just don’t have on a laptop. The machine handled the game easily. My old [Beyerdynamic MMX 2](http://www.headphone.com/rightbetweenyourears/?p=2311 "Beyerdynamic MMX 2") headset was excellent as always. I was going to buy a [TrackIR 5](http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/products/trackir5/ "TrackIR 5") for this game but won’t need to now.
