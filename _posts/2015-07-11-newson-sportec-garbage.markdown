Ever wondered what it looks like when you use a spoke key on powder-coated spoke nipples? Well if the powder coating is very poor quality it looks just like this:

I bought these on eBay, they are Newson Sportec "powder coated" nipples. They are garbage. The eBay seller offered to take a return but am I really going to package them up and pay postage back to Taiwan for $17? No I am not and the seller knows that. Their solution to the spoke key removing the "powder coating" was to only drive them from the rear. I assume that means these spokes are only for machine building, of course they don't call that out on eBay.  

This post is the extent of what I am prepared to do about that $17 - I hope I am saving someone else some time and money.  

Incidentally this was the start of a wheelset for my [SOMA Wolverine](http://www.somafab.com/archives/product/wolverine) build. Disc brakes, belt drive. Updates to come.
