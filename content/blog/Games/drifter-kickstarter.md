Yesterday Colin Walsh (@celsiusgs) tweeted that he was uploading something. Iâ€™ve been waiting for the release of Drifter and I hoped that was it, but it was a kickstarter project! Instead of just an iOS version, if the funding goal is met there will be a PC and Mac release also with expanded graphics and more depth. Did you ever play Elite or Privateer?
Stop reading this now, go look at the project and support it!
