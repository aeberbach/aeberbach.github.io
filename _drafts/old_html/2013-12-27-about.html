<p>Hi – I’m Adam Eberbach, iOS developer living in Melbourne, Australia. Over the years I have done mostly C programming with a mobile/embedded leaning, a bit less C++ and no Java at all. I’ve worked for huge companies and smaller ones, in Australia and the USA. When not programming I like to build or fix things, play guitar or play computer games.</p>

<p><strong>Why "Gray Unicorn"?</strong></p>
<p>Domain names are hard to come by and this one wasn’t taken. A gray unicorn is a very useful creature in Nethack. If you're not playing a neutral character it is safe to sacrifice, you can always throw gems at it for luck, its horn cures poison too. If you don’t know what that’s about you should try <a title="Nethack the game" href="http://thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com" target="_blank">Nethack</a>, the <a title="Salon's Nethack article" href="http://www.salon.com/2000/01/27/nethack/" target="_blank">best game ever</a>.</p>
