A while ago I bought a <A HREF="{{ site.baseurl }}/2012/05/01/a-new-bike-for-winter.html">Spot Acme</A> because I wanted a clean belt drive and a silent bike that would run smoothly through the winter months. Well it mostly does that - though the Alfine 11 hub has been a disappointment, requiring many trips to a service agent and it still leaks oil.
Trouble that bike is a bit of a tank. It's not terribly heavy but I still wanted something a bit lighter, a bit faster, a bit more comfortable. Something that I could fit a small rack and bag to on the days when I don't carry the laptop home, and ride through the summer months.
Then a few things happened at once. Due to the Alfine's service issues I found myself at <A href="http://commutercycles.com.au" target="_blank">Commuter Cycles</A> and saw a Wolverine frame hanging on a wall. Then I saw a reddit post <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2ivtad/my_review_soma_wolverine_vs_surly_straggler/">"My Review: Soma Wolverine vs Surly Straggler"</A>. Then I found some money in my pocket after parting out a computer, and before I knew it I had a receipt for a deposit on a 60cm frame.

<A href="http://www.somafab.com/archives/product/wolverine" target="_blank">SOMA Fab's Wolverine frame</A> is described as so much more than "monster cross". 


**What's on it?**  
This project has been going on for months! People in the office are going to be happy there will be fewer packages delivered for me I am sure. I used a variety of online sellers.
I got the frame, good advice, and some parts from <A href="http://commutercycles.com.au" target="_blank">Commuter Cycles</A>. This is a really great bike shop in Brunswick right on the bike lane and easy to get to by train when the bike is out of action. Money was a little tight so I didn't just ask them to get the parts and build it all though I am confident they would have done a great job. There are always desirable bikes lined up waiting for collection when I visit.
**Building Wheels**
Another reason for doing it myself is that I just like mechanical work, and building wheels seemed like a good challenge. I liked building wheels so much that I build a new set for my Spot Acme also. Anyone who doesn't mind getting their hands mildly dirty should try it - the book I used is Roger Musson's <A href="http://www.wheelpro.co.uk/wheelbuilding/book.php">The Professional Guide to
Wheel Building</A>. He tells you exactly what to do any why. The only tool you absolutely need to buy is a <A href="http://www.amazon.com/KLICKfix-Rixen-Kaul-SPOKEY-professional/dp/B003ZRWA4Y">Spokey</A> - and that's the best one. 
Building wheels is just not hard. If you do it methodically and patiently you can build excellent wheels, you'll save money and learn something.
