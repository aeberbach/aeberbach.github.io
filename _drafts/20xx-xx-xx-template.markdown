**Final Thought**  
Belts and internal gear hubs are probably always going to be less efficient than clean and well-adjusted chains and derailleurs – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_gear" target="_blank">Wikipedia says</A> around 2% lower efficiency for the hub in commuter applications, Gates claim that the Carbon Drive system has equal efficiency to a chain. (Of course they would say that). But that's considering a clean, well-lubricated and well-adjusted chain & derailleur. I expect this bike to maintain its smooth and quiet riding characteristics even after a winter of riding through the kind of grit and mud that you find on bike trails. Most of the bikes that I pass (or that pass me) make plenty of drivetrain noise – if you can hear the bike you can hear wasted effort. I'll update in the spring to tell whether or not this theory has worked out.
  
**Where to buy?**  
I got it from <a href="http://www.blackmountainsports.com.au" target="_blank">Black Mountain Sports</A> in Brisbane who imported and shipped it to me for less that it would have cost me to import directly. I was surprised. Had never heard of them before Spot referred me, I'd be happy to buy through them again.
